### American Express Control Tower
Control Tower is an internal application that provides tools to proactively track customer journeys and monitor platform health. While working on the Control Tower team, I was assigned Front End Jira stories that included forms, buttons, tables and other UI features. Each feature needed to be tested and have 100% unit test coverage. I also had to test the functionality of each feature and made sure that they worked in each environment, up until production. I had to create test suites to adequately cover feature functionality and edge cases. I was also required to perform UAT testing and drive sign-off meetings with Product Owners to push changes to production.
